Automatically Generate the query files:
  For every M36 hit in a hmmsearch result generate a gbk query file including its supercontig number, 2 flanking genes on either side, and their start:stop

Cblaster search:
  Perform a cblaster search for every query file against every strain. 
  For each strain in parallel execute the query for the strain I am running on.
  Save each of those output files in a particular folder under a specific scheme so that we can know weâ€™ve already run it. 
    i.e. M36_1, M36_2
  Any hits in a new strain get cross referenced against the searches already performed
    If the new hits are not found in the previous searches they get a new
